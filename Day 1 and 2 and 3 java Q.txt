"Day 1 and 2:
Task 1: Data Types/Variables
Write a program that declares two integer variables, swaps their values without using a third variable, and prints the result.

Task 2: Operators
Create a program that simulates a simple calculator using command-line arguments to perform and print the result of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division..

Task 3: Control Flow
Write a Java program that reads an integer and prints whether it is a prime number using a for loop and if statements.

Task 4: Constructors
Implement a Matrix class that has a constructor which initializes the dimensions of a matrix and a method to fill the matrix with values.

Task 5: Inheritance
Create a Shape class with a method area() and extend it with Circle and Rectangle classes overriding the area() method appropriately.

Task 6: Packages/Classpath
Create a package com.math.operations and include classes for various arithmetic operations. Demonstrate how to compile and run these using the classpath.

Task 7: Basic Exception Handling
Write a program that attempts to divide by zero, catches the ArithmeticException, and provides a custom error message.

Day 3:
Task 1: Arrays - Declaration, Initialization, and Usage
Create a program that declares an array of integers, initializes it with consecutive numbers, and prints the array in reverse order.

Task 2: List interface
Implement a method that takes a List as an argument and removes every second element from the list, then prints the resulting list.

Task 3: Set interface
Write a program that reads words from a String variable into a Set and prints out the number of unique words, demonstrating the unique property of sets.

Task 4: Map interface
Create a Java class that uses a Map to store the frequency of each word that appears in a given string.
